Pattern Singleton - CentralSingleton

We chose to implement a "Universe Singleton" to hold all other Singletons (e.g. FBAppConfig).
CentralSingleton holds a private CentralSingleton instance variable.
CentralSingleton has a private constructor and a public static Instance property which preforms a lazy creation to the instance variable,
thus ensuring only one instance of CentralSingleton will be created, and it will happen on the creator's initiative.
The lazy creation is thread-safe and has a double-check lock.
The CentralSingleton has one variable for every other Singleton in the project and a public getter.
The getter invoke a generic thread-safe lazy creation method which invokes the private constructor of the class by reflection,
thus ensuring only one instance of each class will be created, and it will happen on the creator's initiative.
